    "While one could construct an entire workflow by chaining together multiple FireTasks within a single Firework, this is often not ideal. For example, we might want to switch between different FireWorkers for different parts of the workflow depending on the computing requirements for each step. Or, we might have a restriction on walltime that necessitates breaking up the workflow into more atomic steps. Finally, we might want to employ complex branching logic or error-correction that would be cumbersome to employ within a single Firework. "
