    # These set the special queries as an ordered list of [<key>, <regex string>, <type>].
    # If the query string satisfies any of the regex, the Mongo query is set as
    # {<key>: type(<search_string>)}. This allows for much more friendly setups for common
    # queries that do not require a user to type in verbose Mongo criteria. Each
    # regex should be uniquely identifying.
    # Types can be any kind of callable function that takes in a string and return
    # a value without other arguments. E.g., int, str, float, etc. You can support
    # more powerful conversions by writing your own processing function, e.g., 
    # mymodule.convert_degress_to_radians. 
    # If none of the regex works, the criteria is interpreted as a Mongo-like dict query.
    query:
      - [pretty_formula, '^[A-Za-z]+$', str]
      - [task_id, '^[0-9]+$', int]

    # A default list of projection key, processing function to display as a table. 
    # Again, processing function can be any callable, and you can define your own.
    # For example, you can take in a float and render it as a fixed decimal.
    summary:
      - [task_id, str]
      - [pretty_formula, str, formula]
      - [spacegroup.symbol, str, spacegroup]
      - [output.final_energy, float, energy]

    # The following defines unique identifiers for each doc. This allows each
    # specific doc to be queried and displayed using this key. If this key is
    # present in the default list of projections, a link will be created to each
    # unique document.

# Basic auth can be set up by specifying user and password below. If these are not
